help about_preference_variables -showwindow  :> To control a command's confirmation behavior, you set $ConfirmPreference accordingly. The default level for $ConfirmPreference is set to High when you start a new shell session. You can set $ConfirmPreference to Low or Medium, but that setting is preserved only for the current shell session. Changes do not affect other open shell sessions. When the command runs, Windows PowerShell checks its internal confirm impact level and if that level is equal to or higher than your $ConfirmPreference setting, Windows PowerShell performs the confirmation action automatically. Therefore, to have the command prompt you to continue or halt execution, set the $ConfirmPreference preference to be less than the command's confirm impact.

For commands that have a High internal confirm impact, the default behavior is to auto-confirm and you will not be prompted to confirm how you want the command to execute. You can override this by specifying -Confirm:$false.

You control a command's -WhatIf behavior by setting the preference to true or false.

To view the current values of the -Whatif or -Confirm preference variables you can simply type $ConfirmPreference or $WhatifPreference at the console. You can also view more details in the Help file by typing help about_preference_variables -showwindow.
